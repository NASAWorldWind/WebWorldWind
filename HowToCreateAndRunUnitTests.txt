Preparation: Install Karma and Jasmine
======================================

If you don't have Node.js, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and
install the appropriate release for your system.

In a terminal, go to the project folder and run “npm install” to install
the necessary dependencies saved as devDependencies in 'package.json' file.

How to Run the Tests
====================

Continuous Testing from the Terminal
------------------------------------
In a terminal, go to the project folder and run “karma start karma.conf.js”.
This will start a process, which automatically runs all tests when source
files are changed and saved as long as the process is running.

Testing from WebStorm
---------------------
If you use the workspace configuration provided in the source code repository,
you already have a run configuration called "Karma Tests".

Otherwise, running karma.conf.js in WebStorm will run the tests only once
unless the re-run option is selected. In this case, all tests are run when
source files are changed similarly to starting Karma from the terminal.

The above-mentioned run configuration can also be created manually with the
following steps:
- Go to Run -> Edit Configurations...
- Click on the '+' button on the top left side (Add New Configuration)
- Select 'Karma' from the menu
- In Configuration file box insert the path of the file 'karma.conf.js'
- In Name box insert the name of the configuration (e.g. Karma Tests)
- Save the configuration

Testing with Other Browsers
---------------------------
By default, the tests run in PhamtomJS. They can be run in other browsers by
changing the list of browsers in karma.conf.js to, for example:

browsers: ['PhantomJS', 'Chrome’]

Please make sure that you also have the approriate launchers available in your
node modules, for example:

npm install karma-chrome-launcher

Integration with the Build Process
----------------------------------
The tests are automatically run when the project is built using the Grunt.

Test Results
------------
The test results are available in "test/<USED_BROWSER>/test-results.xml".

How to Create a Test
====================

Please have a look at the existing tests for reference.

1) Go to the 'test' folder and create a new file. Note that the 'test' folder
   should maintain the same structure as the 'src' folder, so if the module to
   be tested is located in 'src/features/', the related test should be in
   'test/features'.
   
2) Save the file as '<name of the module to be tested>.test.js'

3) The basic structure of the test is the following:

    define([ <list of paths of the modules that this module depends on> ],
           function (< list of parameters>) {

     	"use strict";

     	describe("<Name of the module to be tested to help you understand what the test is supposed to be>",
               function() {
     	  
        ....

     		it("<Description of the expected results of the test, usually it starts with the word 'should'>",
     		function() {
     			expect( ... ).<matcher>(...);

     		})
     	});
     });
