# Web World Wind

3D virtual globe API for JavaScript, developed by NASA. Provides a geographic context, complete with terrain, for 
visualizing geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D. Web World Wind provides high-resolution terrain and 
imagery, retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed. Developers can provide custom terrain and imagery. 
Contains a rich set of features for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a wide range of 
geometric objects. More information at [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov).    

## Get Started

Develop a world-class World Wind application for the web. Setup instructions, developers guides, API documentation and 
more are available at [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov). This GitHub repository contains the 
library source, examples and tutorials.

- [worldwind.arc.nasa.gov](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov) has all things World Wind in one place
- [Developer's Guide](https://webworldwind.org/developers-guide) has a complete description of Web World Wind's functionality. You'll 
  also find there links to many Web World Wind resources, including a user guide. The Web World Wind distribution 
  provides many simple examples showing how to use all of Web World Wind's functionality.
- [World Wind Forum](https://forum.worldwindcentral.com/forum/web-world-wind/web-world-wind-help) provides help from the World Wind community
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WebWorldWind/issues) provides requirements and issue tracking
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm) is used by the NASA World Wind development team

## Example Usage

Here is a simple web app using Web World Wind. It is the contents of SimplestExample.html in the example collection. It 
displays an interactive virtual globe in an HTML canvas.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <!-- This is a very simple example of using Web World Wind. -->
    <html>
    <head lang="en">
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>World Wind Example</title>
        <!-- Include the Web World Wind library. -->
        <script src="http://worldwindserver.net/webworldwind/worldwind.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div style="position: absolute; top: 50px; left: 50px;">
        <!-- Create a canvas for Web World Wind. -->
        <canvas id="canvasOne" width="1024" height="768">
            Your browser does not support HTML5 Canvas.
        </canvas>
    </div>
    <script>
        // Register an event listener to be called when the page is loaded.
        window.addEventListener("load", eventWindowLoaded, false);

        // Define the event listener to initialize Web World Wind.
        function eventWindowLoaded() {
            // Create a World Window for the canvas.
            var wwd = new WorldWind.WorldWindow("canvasOne");

            // Add some image layers to the World Window's globe.
            wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.BMNGOneImageLayer());
            wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.BingAerialWithLabelsLayer());

            // Add a compass, a coordinates display and some view controls to the World Window.
            wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.CompassLayer());
            wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.CoordinatesDisplayLayer(wwd));
            wwd.addLayer(new WorldWind.ViewControlsLayer(wwd));
        }
