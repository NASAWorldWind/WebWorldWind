3D virtual globe API in JavaScript for the web, developed by NASA. The European Space Agency has provided valuable
contributions to this platform since 2015. Web WorldWind provides a geographic context, complete with terrain, and a
collection for shapes for displaying and interacting with geographic or geo-located information in 3D and 2D in any
modern web browser. High-resolution terrain and imagery is retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed, while
enabling developers to include their own custom terrain and imagery.
